# Issuer Qualification

As the First Person Network matures the criteria that Issuers (of PHC, VRC, and PoP credentials) will need to meet SHALL be developed.



The goal of the First Person Network is to be inclusive and principled.

Some loose points to consider:

* If an applicant is rejected or loses their rights to be an issuer, is there an appeal process?
* What impact do [Assurance Levels](assurance-levels.md) have, if any, on the Issuer Qualification?
