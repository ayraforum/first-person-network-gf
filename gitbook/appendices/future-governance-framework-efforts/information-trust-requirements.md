# Information Trust Requirements

Consider pointing to more general inforamtion trust frameworks (e.g. SOC2, ISO270001).&#x20;

\
In addition, the following loose requirements are gathered at this point and need to be considered in the formalization of the Information Trust Requirements:



* Non-correlation: The First Person Network technologies SHALL not allow technical approaches that lead to linkability/correlation of people.&#x20;
  * This includes correlation of signatures.
* Expiry and Revocation:&#x20;
  * The system SHALL support a mechanism for expiry of VRCs, PHCs, and PoP credentials.
  * The system SHOULD support a mechanism for revocation of VRCs, PHCs, and POP credentials.
