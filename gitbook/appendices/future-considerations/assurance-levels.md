# Assurance Levels

The following assurance levels are copied from the [Pan-Canadian Trust Framework - Public Sector Profile v1.5](https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/blob/master/Version1_5/PSP-PCTF-Version-1_5-Consolidated%20Overview-EN.pdf). They begin to explore the key types of assurance level but create a complex (four distinct factors) which may be too onerous for the early days of the FPN.
