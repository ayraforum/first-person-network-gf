# Design Considerations

## Unique Governance



## Behaviour to Encourage

* Communities with a motivation to invite members
* Businesses wanting high-value/high-risk direct person relationships
* First-party data production and sharing
* Privacy protection
*

## Behaviour to Discourage

* Spam
* Phishing&#x20;
* Sybil attacks
* Surveillance (unwanted)



The following was inspired by a [tweet from Greg McKeown](https://x.com/GregoryMcKeown/status/1920146714901815705) (author)&#x20;

A high-trust structure is one where expectations are:

* Expectations are clear
* Goals are shared
* Roles are clear



1. Results. What results does each party want?
   1. People
   2. Organizations
   3. Communities
   4. Infrastructure Providers
2. Roles. Who is going to do what?
3. Rules. What minimum standards must be kept?
4. Resources. What resources are available and needed?
5. Rewards. How will progress be evaluated and rewarded?
