# Welcome

Welcome to the Community Preview 01

This framework is intended to be a starting point for the First Person Network Governance Framework (FPNGF). It was sponsored by donations to [Customer Commons](https://fpngf.ayra.forum/welcome/history#the-community-preview) and it is intended to:

* Provide the scaffolding for concrete governance framework efforts to fit into.
* Begin to answer the many questions that will drive clarify in the First Person Project.
* Be an open place to collaboratively build together



The FPNGF has not reached a starting point - the Community Release.&#x20;

The FPGNF is in its early stages.&#x20;

The base framework established here is intended to bring the community in to take on leadership and ownership of the creation. \
\
The FPNGF will evolve over months and years. As it shifts from conceptual phase to beta and then into production, the needs of the community and the network will shift.&#x20;
