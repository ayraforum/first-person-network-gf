# Welcome

The First Person Network Governance Framework (FPNGF) has not reached a starting point - the Community Release.&#x20;

The FPGNF is in its early stages.&#x20;

The base framework established here is intended to bring the community in to take on leadership and ownership of the creation. \
\
The FPNGF will evolve over months and years. As it shifts from conceptual phase to beta and then into production, the needs of the community and the network will shift.&#x20;
