# Referrals

The general "rules" around referrals (allow, required opt-in - dual or single) have NOT been included.



{% hint style="info" %}
LOOSE NOTES:&#x20;

Referrals - how do we enable the single-/double-opt-in for people-to-people? People-to-business/business-to-????

* Right-to-refer (with Revocation?)
* Disclose-affiliate-fee
* (FPN - should allow for it - Ayra likely will create one mode - ) - MAKE ROOM FOR IT BUT DEFER TO FUTURE/ELSEWHERE
{% endhint %}
