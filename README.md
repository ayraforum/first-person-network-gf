# Welcome

Welcome to the First Person Network Governance Framework.&#x20;

The content here is the initial version (Community Preview 01) and serves as a starting point for the development of the First Person Network Governance Framework (FPNGF). Donations to Customer Commons sponsored it, and it is intended to:

* Provide the scaffolding for concrete governance framework efforts to fit into.
* Begin to answer the many questions that will drive clarity in the First Person Project.
* Be an open place to collaboratively build together.

The First Person Network is in its early stages of formation. We don't have all the answers. We have attempted here to ask the early questions and provide the scaffolding for the community to work from.\
\
The FPNGF will evolve over the course of months and years. As it shifts from the conceptual phase to beta and then into production, the needs of the community and the network will shift.&#x20;

The base framework established here is intended to bring the community in to take on leadership and ownership of the creation.&#x20;
