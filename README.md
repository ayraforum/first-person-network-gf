# Welcome

Welcome to the Community Preview 01

This version of the governance framework serves as a starting point for the First Person Network Governance Framework (FPNGF). It was sponsored by donations to [Customer Commons](https://fpngf.ayra.forum/welcome/history#the-community-preview) and it is intended to:

* Provide the scaffolding for concrete governance framework efforts to fit into.
* Begin to answer the many questions that will drive clarify in the First Person Project.
* Be an open place to collaboratively build together

The base framework established here is intended to bring the community in to take on leadership and ownership of the creation. \
\
The FPNGF will evolve over the course of months and years. As it shifts from the conceptual phase to beta and then into production, the needs of the community and the network will shift.&#x20;
