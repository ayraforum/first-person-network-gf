# Welcome

Welcome to the Community Preview 01

This framework serves as a starting point for the First Person Network Governance Framework (FPNGF) development. It was sponsored by donations to [Customer Commons](https://fpngf.ayra.forum/welcome/history#the-community-preview) and it is intended to:

* Provide the scaffolding for concrete governance framework efforts to fit into.
* Begin to answer the many questions that will drive clarify in the First Person Project.
* Be an open place to collaboratively build together.

The First Person Network is in its early stages of formation. We don't have all the answers. We have attempted here to ask the early questions and provide the scaffolding for the community to work from.\
\
The FPNGF will evolve over months and years. As it shifts from conceptual phase to beta and then into production, the needs of the community and the network will shift.&#x20;

The base framework established here is intended to bring the community in to take on leadership and ownership of the creation. \
