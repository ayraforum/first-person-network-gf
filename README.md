# Welcome

Welcome to the initial stage of the First Person Network Governance Framework effort.&#x20;

You'll be seeing a starting point here - something to get thoughts flowing, ideas moving, and to set an initial set of guardrails for the FPN to begin to form.

It is not intended to be a "version 1" - think of it as more a collection of ideas that we can use to refine what the framework needs to become.&#x20;

The FPNGF aligns with the phased approach shared in early June by Drummond Reed. It's the earliest starting point.&#x20;
